This Arduino-Automatic-Toll-Booth-System project aims to automate the process of toll collection using an Arduino microcontroller. The system uses sensors to detect the presence of a vehicle, and an RFID reader to identify the vehicle through an RFID tag. When a vehicle approaches the toll booth, the sensor activates the system, and the RFID reader scans the tag to identify the vehicle. The system then automatically deducts the toll amount from the vehicle owner's prepaid account. If the account balance is sufficient, the barrier opens to allow the vehicle to pass; if not, it remains closed and prompts for manual payment. This project enhances efficiency, reduces human intervention, and minimizes wait times at toll booths.
